# Copilot Instructions for CultureBenchmark TestRepo

## Project Overview
This is a minimal test repository for benchmarking purposes. The codebase is currently in early stages with placeholder files.

## Key Files
- `Test.py` - Primary Python test module (currently minimal)
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - This file

## Development Guidelines

### Python Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 conventions for all Python files
- Include docstrings for functions and modules
- Use type hints where applicable

### Testing Approach
- Test files should follow the `Test*.py` naming convention
- Place tests in the root directory until the project structure expands

### Documentation
- Keep `README.md` updated with project changes and setup instructions
- Document any non-obvious patterns or architectural decisions

## Next Steps
As this project grows:
1. Define the specific benchmarking criteria in README.md
2. Implement test suites with clear purpose and metrics
3. Add configuration files if needed (e.g., `pytest.ini`, `setup.py`)
4. Create appropriate module structure when code complexity increases
5. Update this file with project-specific conventions

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, cache, and virtual environments
